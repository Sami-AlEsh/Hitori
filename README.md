### Classic Hitori
Each puzzle consists of a square grid with numbers appearing in all squares. The object is to shade squares so:

* No number appears in a row or column more than once.
* Shaded (black) squares do not touch each other vertically or horizontally.
* When completed, all un-shaded (white) squares create a single continuous area.
